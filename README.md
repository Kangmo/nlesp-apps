# Dual License
## NLESP Commercial License for OEMs, ISVs and VARs
 
Nanolat provides its example apps connecting to NLESP under a dual license model designed to meet the development and distribution needs of both commercial distributors (such as OEMs, ISVs and VARs) and open source projects.
 
## For OEMs, ISVs, VARs and Other Distributors of Commercial Applications

OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), ISVs (Independent Software Vendors), VARs (Value Added Resellers)  and other distributors that combine and distribute commercially licensed software with NLESP software but do not wish to distribute the source code for the commercially licensed software under version 3 of the GNU General Public License (the "GPL") must enter into a commercial license agreement with Nanolat.

The commercial license is similar to BSD without requiring to open source code of your app.

For start-up companies, Nanolat provides commercial license and technical support at small percentage of equity share. 
Focus on your client side development and grow your business quicker by using NLESP. 
Send an email to support@nanolat.com for the details.

## For Open Source Projects and Other Developers of Open Source Applications
 
For developers of Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under the GPL v3 or AGPL v3 that want to combine and distribute those FOSS applications with NLESP software, Nanolatâ€™s NLESP open source software licensed under the GPL v3 is the best option.
