SNS Android application
==========


# Description

SNS Android application is based on Twimight, which is an open-source Twitter client.



It's a prototype application for checking whether our service really works or not. It is not compatible with Twitter at all. It doesn't support all the features which Twitter provides, but the code remains still. If you wanna make something similar to this, I strongly recommend you to make your own from the scratch.
